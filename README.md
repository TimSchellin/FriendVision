## How to use this repository


You will need to choose a folder to put your friend's face images. The images should be in the following format: friend_name.jpg

This python script loads two variables from an external file called "project_paths.txt" (excluded for security reasons) the contents of this text file are just two lines, the path to the folder containing your friend's photos and the IP address of your video stream. a sample project_paths.txt looks like this:

    path/to/image_folder
    192.168.1.100

That's it, go ahead and run the script!
